    <p>I am now currently taking up Software Development Program in Bow Valley College. In the Philippines, I
        successfully completed the required time and deliverables needed for Master of Science in Information
        Technology. I have experienced several jobs such as Intern at PLDT; I have completed the required
        time and deliverables needed in the course/subject. I had been one of the office staff at the Registrarâ€™s office
        wherein I have
        accomplished filing and other paperwork needed by my immediate superior. I have assisted in the enrollment
        process and helped in
        the preparation of reports and accomplished the same before the scheduled deadlines; Eventually, I became an IT
        faculty at STI College, Quezon City University, and National University and taught several major subjects like
        Computer Fundamentals, Project Management, Computer Networks, Data Structure, Java Programming, Web Programming,
        and Visual Basic Programming. I have been
        knowledgeable in programming and other major subjects which are in line with my areas of specialization which is
        IT. </p><br>
    <p>I
        also have experience in advising and paneling of thesis projects of the IT/CS students. I tried to work as a
        Web
        Developer in E-cash Pay Asia, it is a remittance company wherein as a Web Developer I am responsible for
        maintaining the
        software especially the front-end side used by the clients. My dream is to work in the IT industry as a Software
        Developer which is why I study here in Canada to learn the latest practices and tools that are being used in
        programming</p>
